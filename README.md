# vimconfig
Vim config files for some cool color schemes and nice functionality!

HOW TO INSTALL:

- First, you'll need to install a plugin manager for Vim, in this case we're going to use Vim Plug, you can install it using the following comand:
	- curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.v 

- Now, you have to check that there's no file named ".vimrc" in your home folder, if there is, you have to delete it.

- Then, you're going to copy the ".vimrc" file in this repository to your home folder.

- You will see many lines that set various parameters for Vim to run on, they are commented explaining what they do.

- I encourage you to look on the internet for info on how to configure it to your liking even further, using this as a base! 

- Once you have your configuration ready, you're gonna have to run the following commands to apply it:
	- "source %" To make Vim take in all the code and use it, "%" in Vim means the entire document.
	- "PlugInstall" To install the plugins you just listed on the .vimrc file.

- Now you should be all set!

- Good luck on the rest of the pool üèä
